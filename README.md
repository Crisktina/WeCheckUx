There is a rubric system for the critical evaluation of interfaces, developed by a research group from the Universitat Oberta de Catalunya. Different evaluators can review web pages and score them using this system. The client needs a website where these rubrics can be entered, so that registered or unregistered users can evaluate websites and obtain a visual result of the evaluations, by evaluator and by average.
